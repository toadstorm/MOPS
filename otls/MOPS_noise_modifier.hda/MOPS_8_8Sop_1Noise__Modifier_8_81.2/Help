"""Moves instances according multiple types of noise fields."""

This node is a replacement for the MOPs Curl Noise modifier. MOPs Noise Modifier can push objects along a curl noise field, but it can
also use many other types of noise fields as well. Objects can be pushed along in their local space (based on their N or up vectors), or
they can be pushed in world space, depending on the Noise Signature.

@inputs

Packed Primitives:
    Plug in MOPs instances in here.

@parameters

== General ==

Mode:
    #id: noisemode
    Select how instances will be moved through noise field.
    - Simple: Simply move instances in the direction of the noise.
    - Advect: Advect instances through the noise field over time (hit play to see effect).
    
Affect Position:
    #id: scale
    Enable the modification of point positions.
    
Position Amount:
    #id: scale
    A multiplier on the strength of the position effect.
    
Affect Rotation:
    #id: orientclones
    Orient instances according to their motion through the noise field.
    
Rotation Amount:
    #id: rotation_amount
    Available in Simple mode only. A multiplier on the strength of the rotation effect.
    
Aim Weight:
    #id: aim_weight
    Available in Advect Mode only. The bias between the previous timestep's orientation and the current timestep's. Lower numbers make instances turn towards the direction of motion more slowly. A value of 1.0 implies that all objects will immediately turn towards their direction of motion each frame. This can cause jittery motion, so use with caution.
    
Affect Scale:
    #id: do_scale
    Enable the modification of point/packed primitive scales.
    
Scale Amount:
    #id: A multiplier on the strength of the scale effect.
    
Do Falloff:
    #id: do_falloff
    Scale each primitive's motion by the `mops_falloff` attribute.
    
Output Trails:
    #id: do_trails
    Generate trails from the path of each object. Only available in Advect mode.
    
== Noise Properties ==

Noise Signature:
    #id: signature
    The type of noise to generate. Scalar noise is a single value; vector noise is three values (x,y,z).
    
Forward Axis:
    #id: forwardaxis
    If the "Noise Signature" is set to "Float", the axis in which to move instances. Defaults to Normal (+Z).
    
See [MOPs Noise Patterns|Node:sop/MOPS--Noise_Patterns-1.1] for help on other parameters in this section.

== Trail Settings ==

Trails are only available in Advect Mode.

Polyline Trails:
    #id: do_polylines
    If enabled, trails will be generated as polylines (not points).
    
Group Name:
    #id: groupname
    The group to place the trails in.
    
Inherit Attributes:
    #id: trail_attrs
    A list of point attributes to inherit from the source packed primitives / points.
    
Generate Curve UV Attribute:
    #id: do_curveu
    If enabled, an attribute will be generated on the trails corresponding to the parametric value of each point along the curve (0-1).
    
Curve UV Attribute Name:
    #id: curveu_name
    The name of the Curve UV attribute to generate.
    
== Solver Settings ==

Update Attributes:
    #id: attribname
    Advect mode only. A list of attributes to update as the simulation runs.
