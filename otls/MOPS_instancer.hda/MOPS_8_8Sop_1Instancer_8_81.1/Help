"""Copies objects to various patterns, or onto a curve or mesh."""

The MOPs Instancer generates MOPs packed primitives and distributes them in various ways. Each distribution type has its own set of parameters.
Any number of objects can be input into the Instancer; the Index Attribute and Indexing Mode parameters determine which of the input objects is copied to each point.
The objects that are generated are standard Houdini Packed Primitives, with a few extra attributes added for use with the rest of the MOPs system. 

@parameters

== Instancing ==

Indexing Mode:
    #id: index_mode
    The method by which indexes are generated, to determine which input object is copied to each point. This creates the i@mops_index point attribute.
    
Index Random Seed:
    #id: index_seed
    When using the Random indexing mode, the random seed used to determine i@mops_index.
    
Index Attribute:
    #id: index_attr
    When using the Input Mesh distribution method, you can provide an integer point attribute from the Input Mesh that will be used to create i@mops_index. Hint: You can use a MOPs Index From Attribute SOP to create this attribute on your Input Mesh.

    #id: viewportlod
    The display method to use when showing the instanced primitives in the viewport.
    
Enable Material Overrides:
    #id: do_material_overrides
    Enable the Material Override parameters for the Instance Objects.
       
Instance Objects:
    #id: instanceobjects

        #id: instancepath#
        The path to the SOP or object to instance.
        
    File Path:
        #id: instancefilepath#

        The method by which to choose the frame to load for each instance. There are two modes available:
        
        * Frame Number: You can directly set a frame number (such as @Frame) via the Frame Number attribute.
        * Attribute: You can use a point attribute from the Template Object (if you are using Mesh or Curve instancing modes), specified via the Frame Attribute.
    
    Probability:
        #id: instance_probability#

Cusp Faces:
    #id mesh_scatter_do_cusp_faces

== Sorting ==

Name Prefix:
    #id: name_prefix
    The prefix to add to each instance's name attribute. This can be useful for ensuring that multiple MOPs streams don't have clashing names in a Packed RBD simulation, for example.

Name Start Number:
    #id: name_start
    The starting number for each piece's name attribute.
    
ID Start Number:
    #id: id_offset
    The starting number to use as the id for each instance.
