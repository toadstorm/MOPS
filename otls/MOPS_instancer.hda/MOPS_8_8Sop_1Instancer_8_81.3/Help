"""Copies objects to various patterns, or onto a curve or mesh."""

The MOPs Instancer generates MOPs packed primitives and distributes them in various ways. Each distribution type has its own set of parameters.
Any number of objects can be input into the Instancer; the Index Attribute and Indexing Mode parameters determine which of the input objects is copied to each point.
The objects that are generated are standard Houdini Packed Primitives, with a few extra attributes added for use with the rest of the MOPs system. 

@parameters

== Instancing ==

Indexing Mode:
    #id: index_mode
    The method by which indexes are generated, to determine which input object is copied to each point. This creates the i@mops_index point attribute.
    
Index Random Seed:
    #id: index_seed
    When using the Random indexing mode, the random seed used to determine i@mops_index.
    
Index Attribute:
    #id: index_attr
    When using the Input Mesh distribution method, you can provide an integer point attribute from the Input Mesh that will be used to create i@mops_index. Hint: You can use a MOPs Index From Attribute SOP to create this attribute on your Input Mesh.

Quick Add Objects:
    #id: quick_add
    You can quickly add objects to the Instancer by picking them using the list button, or by simply dragging them into the parameter box.
    
=== Global Options ===

Points Only (No Instances):
    #id: points_only
    Only arrange points with the appropriate attributes; don't actually generate any packed primitives. You can use this if you intend to copy objects to the points later using Copy to Points.

    #id: viewportlod
    The display method to use when showing the instanced primitives in the viewport.
    
Transform Type:
    #id: xformtype

Pack From Default:
    #id: packfromdefault
    When connecting new inputs, the default packed pivot to use for the input. See "Pack From" in the Instance Objects Block.

        * Frame Number: You can directly set a frame number (such as @Frame) via the Frame Number attribute.
        * Attribute: You can use a point attribute from the Template Object (if you are using Mesh or Curve instancing modes), specified via the Frame Attribute.
    
    Probability:
        #id: instance_probability#
        The weighted probability of each instance type. Lower numbers are less likely to appear in the Random Indexing mode.
    
    Pack From:
        #id: pack_from#
        Where the default pivot for the packed primitive should be placed: at the centroid of the instance geometry, or at the world origin.        
        
    Material Override:
        #id: instance_material#
        The material to apply to the instances under this path. Only active if "Enable Material Overrides" is enabled; otherwise the material already applied to the SOP or object is used.

    When instancing onto an animated mesh, the frame to use as the "rest" (default) frame. Instances will automatically interpolate their positions and orientations on an animated mesh, based on this default state. 
    If your template mesh has a changing point count, you will probably want to set this to @Frame in order to update the topology from the source.
